# UniversalDatabaseIntegration
Database Interface is an industry-standard tool for application development. Using Database Interface, developers can interact with any back end software (i.e. Oracle, MS-SQL Server, MS-Access, My-SQL etc). The database interface can be used to build, test, and debug PL/SQL packages, procedures, triggers, and functions. Database Interface users can create and edit database objects such as tables, views, indexes, constraints, and users. Database Interface's SQL Editor provides an easy and efficient way to write and test scripts and queries, and its powerful data grids provide an easy way to view and edit data related to any DBMS/RDBMS tool.
